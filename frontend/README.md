This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).

in order to build properly you need to clone the v9 branch of elm-mdl into the vendor folder
you can run `cd ./vendor; git clone -b v9 https://github.com/debois/elm-mdl.git`, the dependencies
        "debois/elm-dom": "1.2.3 <= v < 2.0.0",
        "elm-lang/mouse": "1.0.1 <= v < 2.0.0"
in the elm-package.json are needed for this as well
